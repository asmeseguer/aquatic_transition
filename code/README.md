Scripts to run the main analysis in:
AS Meseguer, R Carrillo, SW Graham, I Sanmartín. Why angiosperm lineages on aquatic environments are species poor? Macroevolutionary dynamics in the transition of angiosperms to aquatic environments.
This folder contains the RevBayes and R scripts to run and plot the results of the constant birth-death (BD), episodic birth-death (EBD), and HiSSE models in RevBayes. These scripts have been modified by Isabel Sanmartín from the RevBayes manual.
It also contains R scripts I created to extract the timing, type and number of dispersal events from the Stochastic Character Mapping RevBayes output.

I've done my best to comment the scripts so that others may modify them freely. Feel welcome to contact me with any quesitons.
