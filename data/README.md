A brief description of the data files:
	•	GBOTB-genuslevel-ult-cut-angiosp.tre contains a time-calibrated MCC tree for 10360 angiosperm genera. Note, this is the original GBOTB tree of Smith & Brown (2018) AmJBot cut at the genus level, keeping only angiosperm lineages.
	•	GBOTB-genuslevel-ult-cut-angiosp-aquatic.tre contains a time-calibrated MCC tree for 271 aquatic angiosperm genera. Note, to generate this tree, the genus-level angiosperm GBOTB was pruned to generate subtrees comprising only current aquatic genera.
	•	GBOTB-genuslevel-ult-cut-angiosp-terrestrial.tre contains a time-calibrated MCC tree for 10089 terrestrial angiosperm genera. Note, to generate this tree, the genus-level angiosperm GBOTB was pruned to generate subtrees comprising only current terrestrial genera. 
	•	Bisse-coding-genus-widasaquat.nex contains the “aquatic/terrestrial” coding of the tips at the GBOTB-genuslevel-ult-cut-angiosp.tre when polymorphic species are considered as aquatic.
	•	Bisse-coding-genus-widasterr.nex contains the “aquatic/terrestrial” coding of the tips at the GBOTB-genuslevel-ult-cut-angiosp.tre when polymorphic species are considered as terrestrial.
